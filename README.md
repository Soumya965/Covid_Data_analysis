# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 data using Python, focusing on trends, patterns, and key insights from the pandemic. The dataset is cleaned, processed, and visualized to identify cases, recoveries, and deaths over time. The final analysis presents all visualizations together using subplots to generate a comprehensive story.

## Data Sources
- The dataset is sourced from [mention dataset source, e.g., WHO, John Hopkins University, Kaggle].
- It contains information on COVID-19 cases, recoveries, deaths, and other key statistics.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
- **Visualization:** Subplots for storytelling insights
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Used for executing and presenting the analysis

## Key Analysis & Insights
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed missing values and standardized column formats.
   - Processed the dataset for better readability and analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Identified trends in daily cases, recoveries, and fatalities.
   - Used statistical summaries and visualizations for insights.
3. **Visualization:**
   - Line plots and bar charts for case trends.
   - Subplot integration to showcase a holistic view of the pandemic’s impact.

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
   ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook covid19_data_analysis_final_v2.ipynb
   ```

## Conclusion
This project provides a data-driven perspective on COVID-19 trends, utilizing Python and visualization techniques to generate insights. The final subplot integration allows for a comprehensive view of the pandemic’s effects.
